- 👋 Hi, I’m @MahireAsadzade
- 👀 I’m interested in data science. I use machine learning tools to analyze large datasets of materials properties to establish correlations between certain properties, and for outlier detection. Using data visualization techniques also helps me to produce high quality visualizations of research data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML algorithms, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, totally AI technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on online ML hackathons with someone who is willing to learn.
